CHANGED: the type classes `Clash.Signal.Bundle.Bundle` and `Clash.Signal.Delay.Bundle.Bundle`
are now merged into a single type class `Clash.Prelude.Bundle.Bundle`. The type
class has a new signature:

```
class Bundle f a res | f a -> res, f res -> a, a res -> f  where
  type Unbundled f a
  type Unbundled f a = f a
  bundle :: res -> f a
  unbundle :: f a -> res
```

Migration guide:

When you have a polymorphic type signature involving the `Unbundle` type family:

```
f :: Unbundled dom i -> ...
```

you will have to change your code to:

```
f :: Bundle (Signal dom) i fi => fi -> ...
```

When you have a monomorphic type signatures involving the `Unbundled` type
family:

```
f :: Unbundled dom (a,b) -> ...
```

you will have to change your code to:

```
f :: Unbundled (Signal dom) (a,b) -> ...
```
